# Security policy

easyssf sits in the authentication path of the applications that use it: it decides whether a
security event is genuine and, in the Spring Boot integrations, whether an access token or a session
is still valid. Reports about anything that weakens that are welcome.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability.

- Write to **oss@easyssf.org**. If you need to send something confidential, ask for a key first and
  you will get one by return mail.
- Or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/easyssf/easyssf/security/advisories/new)
  on the repository, once it is enabled there.

Please include the version or commit, the module (for example `easyssf-receiver` or the Spring Boot
starter), what an attacker can achieve, and the steps or a test that reproduces it. A signed SET that
is wrongly accepted, or a push request that is wrongly acknowledged, is the most useful form.

You will get an acknowledgement, usually within a few days, and we will keep you informed while the
report is being handled. We ask for the time to prepare a fix and a release before details are
published, and we credit reporters in the advisory unless they prefer not to be named.

## Supported versions

easyssf is experimental and has no releases yet. Until 1.0, only the latest release receives
fixes; earlier releases are not patched.

## What is in scope

- Verification of Security Event Tokens: signatures, `typ`, `iss`, `aud`, `jti`, `iat`, key
  retrieval and the accepted algorithms.
- Authentication of the push endpoint and the handling of malformed requests.
- De-duplication, token revocation and session termination logic, including the database-backed
  stores.
- Calls to the transmitter: token handling, metadata discovery, stream management.

Vulnerabilities in dependencies such as Nimbus JOSE + JWT or Spring Security should be reported to
those projects; a report here is still useful if easyssf uses them in a way that makes the problem
worse.
